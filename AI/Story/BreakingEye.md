> Emulating battleye Anti-Cheat software, battleye communicate in simple way there is only 5 packet to emulate battleye ping packet, init packet, start packet, request/responses packet. by emulating all packet we can trick battleye server into thinking that battleye client is actually running while in fact its even not installed. To do full emulation we must do packet capturing first which is unique to each device and can't be replicated.  
> By doing this we force anti-cheat software to reload the map and get the exact locations of all the joined game. its work very well and we see cheaters trying to avoid the cheats we put in place. you need to be carefull though as these cheats will also affect legit players, this is problematic for the coup since we need a good number of legit players to happen upon the game.

> After successfully executing the plan we can start moving forward.  
>   
> We decide to implement the plan slowly, starting with low risks and then moving onto the high risk options. This is to prevent the possibility of an accident happening which can shatter the fragile Façade of Truth.  
> The plan starts with capturing packets from the DOIPV central command post. This is fairly easy to do as all we need to do is sneak into the building when it's empty and wait until a DOIPV member leaves his workstation to go to the bathroom or something.  
> Capturing the packets is fairly easy, we just route the capture captures the traffic through our own machine and wait.  
> The next step is tricking DOIPV into believing our fake client is actually working or genuine. We do this by capturing and replaying client packets. To do this we set up a small machine on a public network that perfectly replays the DOIPV client. All we need to do is find a way of getting our hands on a DOIPV unit and we can plant one in the field and pretend we found it there.  
> The plan starts off with tricking DOIPV into going to our location, this is simple we just set up a small trap. we Place a cheap wired ethernet device near a portal and point it at our machine. Next we set up another machine nearby and wait. DOIPV Captures an ethernet packet from a random portal and connects to our machine. Of course at this point our machine replays a harmless packet and just closes the connection. This causes the DOIPV operator to disconnect and curse loudly before returning to the portal he came from.  
> We repeat this a few times with different DOIPV operators and identify the one who appears to be in charge, he is also the only one with an aggressive tone of voice so we approach him carefully and offer our help in driving the invading forces back to their rightful places.  
> He naturally distrusts us at first but we assure him that if he allows us access to the command post we can stop this plague in its tracks.  
> He reluctantly agrees but with the following stipulation...  
>   
> The following week sees a marked change in the amount of allied forces in the area. The allied commander from the other day is in the same building as the Façade and seems fairly happy with how things are going. Your presence while no longer being questioned is still a problem you need to think about.  
>   
> You could go back to your old ways and keep a low profile but you're fairly certain the Façade has a list of your crimes that they will inevitably try to use against you if you bumble into something you shouldn't or claim something you didn't actually do in the first place. It would also be fairly easy for you to just not return to the building at all and continue your work from home as long as you keep a low profile.  
>   
> You could bring your old ways back and try to actively manipulate things through intimidation but really that's just going to result in you getting run over and the plague spreading. The allied commander is fairly happy with things the way they are right now, he doesn't want your input and you'd rather not risk pissing him off.  
> Alternatively you could try to go back to your original plan of working from home but that's going to result in you not being around to help the allied commander when he really needs it.  
>   
> As you ponder your options there is a knock on your door. You open it to find the allied commander there with your list of names.  
>   
> "Please, I need your help." He says in a rather broken voice.  
>   
> He steps inside your house with all his equipment and following behind him. He hands you the list without looking at you.  
>   
> "I need you to check these people. Make sure they are trustworthy and if they aren't then kill them."  
>   
> You've never heard him sound so desperate before, you have to know what's going on.  
>   
> "Wait, what?" You ask.  
>   
> He's already turned and headed over to the computers.  
>   
> "Just do it." He says and starts typing away.  
>   
> You grab him by the shoulder and turn him around to face you.  
>   
> "Why?" You demand.  
>   
> He looks at you but his eyes don't seem to focus.  
>   
> "The virus, it's gone berserk. I can't stop it and I can't trace it either. But I know that it originated here and came through those portals."  
> "How? I was the one who closed those portals! I ensured the barrier was up!"  
> "I know that too, but you can't keep something up if it isn't there in the first place."  
>   
> You're not really following his logic.  
>   
> "But the DOIPV, they said they sealed it. They wouldn't lie."  
> "I'm sure they didn't, but I can't trust them either now. What if they just made it look like the barrier went down so they could release the virus at their leisure? Then again, they were the only ones who seemed to know what they were doing...damn it, I'm tired. This is all my fault. If I had just listened to him (referring to the allied commander) none of this would have happened. Argh, I'm too tired to think clearly anymore. Just do it. Don't question him, just kill them all. You can do that right? Just kill them? Just like that. I've been wondering about you, have I been too harsh with you? Please just do this one thing for me, for Keira. Kill them all. Keira, you were so close to your family, just get them out of here and to a better location. Please, just for Keira. I love you, I always will. Remember that. Good-bye my love. And good riddance. Keira will be much safer now. She doesn't need a priest anymore. She doesn't need you,"  
> With those words, you feel a presence grab your wrist. It's you.  
>   
> You can't breathe.  
>   
> Your heart races.  
>   
> "Come on. You need to move. NOW. We can finish this later, let's go! This is no time to be lazing around! Come on!  
>   
> You need to act now.  
> "Alright, alright, let's get this over with," you say.  
> You hear a loud hum fill the room and then a flash of light appears. It's so bright that you have to close your eyes to avoid permanent damage. You feel hands lifting you up and out of the house. Sounds begin to bleed in with the flash. You hear someone yelling about an infection has been detected. A woman's voice screams for all soldiers to head to their positions. There is then a boom and the barrier drops.  
> When your eyes adjust, you find yourself in a small underground bunker; it's empty except for a few metal cots and some equipment. You're out in the open now, but you don't think anyone could have heard the gunshots. You look around and find a small opening leading down. You hear Noakes whimpering in terror.  
> "It's alright Noakes, you'll be safe in here with me. We're going to stay safe in here till the infection passes."  
> Noakes doesn't look comforted, but he does stop crying. You realize he has a point; even with the doors and windows closed, there is no guarantee that the infection won't get in. It probably has already spread through the air by how harsh your noses are starting to hurt. You hate to admit it, but Noakes is probably right. The military would have had decontamination procedures in place. You hate to think of all the people you just killed in there. All of those people were probably just doing their job, sure you killed some of them, but they had it comin' and in the scheme of things, it's not like you were overly nice to them.  
> "Alright Noakes, we're going to stay down here for 10 minutes, starting now. If I can't detect any infected within that time, we'll get up and figure out what to do next. So what's the plan? Wait out the 10 minutes and then wait some more? Throw a rock at the tunnel to see what happens? I'm not sure we're in any position to do any of that."  
> "I thought you said you were a priest! You can't just sit there and let them eat us!"  
> "No, I'm a rogue. Just like you. And for the same reasons."  
> "What do you mean? Why are we killing them then?"  
> "Because they're the enemy. That's why. There's no other."  
> "Well I know you're an excellent killer, but how do we know they won't kill us?"  
> "We don't. But we're prepared to risk it. Remember, we're not just killing for food, there's also the safety in numbers."  
>   
> Noakes seems to think that over, then he motions down towards the opening they came in at.  
>
